## Simplework

I did it to practice [Laravel](https://laravel.com), had to do it in [Laravel 4.2](https://laravel.com/docs/4.2/) due to work constraints, and added a few more features that weren't covered in the course. 

It was quite a challenge to do it in a older version of Laravel.

The idea of the project comes from [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) and their amazing course 
[Laravel From Scratch](series/laravel-6-from-scratch/).
